Abstract:
In this paper, the classic NP-Complete Boolean Satisfiability Problem, or SAT, is interpreted as a reinforcement learning task. The model, called DeepSAT, successfully solves instances of the SAT problem with a limited number of input variables. This paper illustrates how reinforcement learning is applied to the SAT problem, discusses the findings observed and limitations of the model, and provides supporting theoretical background for the topic.
